            <h4><br>
                Origami is the art of paper folding, which is often associated with Japanese culture. In modern usage,
                the word "origami" is used as an inclusive term for all folding practices, regardless of their culture
                of origin.The first works of original modern origami (in the 1950's) are due to the master Yoshizawa
                Akira. It is also known that the Arab world was making paper in the eight century, and the Moors brought
                paper folding to Spain in the twelfth century.
